## About MushcFlow

MushcFlow has created with idea to make a light and simple music player, but with some cool features, like:

- An intuitive interface, simple to use! ✨
- You can change the speed of your favorites songs 🔢 
- Download new songs inside the app! 🔽
- See the thumbnail of your songs! 🖼️
- A log system, to know when something wrong happens! 🚨

## Compilation/Installation

⚠️ I strongly recommend you to use QtCreator (6.9.1+) if want to change something in the code

To install, you just need to download the "MushcFlow.zip", and open the "MushcFlow.exe"!
